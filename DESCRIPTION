Description: Call peaks for two samples: target and control. It will
        count the reads for tiles of the genome and then convert it to
        ratios. The ratios will be corrected and smoothed. The z-scores
        is calculated for each counting windows over the background.
        The peaks will be detected based on z-scores.
